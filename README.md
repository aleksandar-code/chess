## Features

Player vs Player.

All of the modern chess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess">rules</a> apply.

No time control.

Black pieces are in red and white pieces are in blue.

## How to play / Instructions

If the program doesn't start like expected, type "ruby lib/script.rb" in the replit command line.

If you want to play on your local computer you will need a recent version of Ruby (3.0.2 is the version used to make the game).

You will be asked if you want to continue a saved game or start a new game.

All of the modern chess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess">rules</a> apply.

To resign just type quit instead of typing in a move.

To move pieces type the piece's square coordinates and the destination square coordinates and press Enter:

e2e4

will move the white king pawn by 2 squares.

## Known issues

The UI isn't always very clear, I could add a menu and a help command.

May be a possibility to configurate the pieces colors, to remove or add move notation.

## Information

The hardest, most complex and time consuming project I've worked on. It was not so hard that I couldn't solve problems, it was so hard that it was very time-consuming.
The hardest problems to solve were, how to verify if a move is legal or not if the king was concerned. How to know if this is a stalemate, a checkmate, or just a check on the king? How to know if this move is legal, does it leave the king in check?

I certainly put a lot of time in doing system design for this project, i tried to write concise and meaningful methods once i ran into bugs that i couldn't solve due to the very long methods.

Ultimately, this is my favorite project and one that i spent the most time on by far. 

Chess is still one of my favorite games, and making this project live was my dream.
